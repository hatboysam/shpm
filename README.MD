# Simple Haskell Project Manager (SHPM)

### What is it?
It's like todo.txt, but I made it in Haskell and it's much simpler

### Why should I use it over todo.txt
You probably shouldn't, but I like it

### How do I use it?
shpm list -> list all tasks
shpm add "Some Task" -> add "Some Task" to the bottom of the list
shpm remove -> list all tasks and choose one to remove
shpm remove n -> remove task #n from the list

### Is that all?
Yep, for now.  Soon I'll be adding task grouping by project and other cool features.  Stay tuned.
